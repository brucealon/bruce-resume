\sectionhead{Employment}

\employer
  {NortonLifeLock, Inc. (formerly Symantec Corp.) --- Tempe, AZ}
  {Principle Software Engineer, 2016--Present}

\accomplish{Led the migration of the consumer support web site and other
applications from IT-managed on premises infrastructure to team managed
Kubernetes clusters in Microsoft Azure.}

\accomplish{Trained other members of my team in the use and management of
Docker and Kubernetes via YAML configuration files and command
line tools.}

\accomplish{Supported and extended multiple REST APIs running on
Ruby/Sinatra.}

\accomplish{Supported an internal Jenkins CI/CD application relied on by
several teams. This is running in a Docker container in
Kubernetes, which provided some interesting challenges and is not,
perhaps, the recommended configuration for Jenkins, but
maintaining it was essential to migrating to Kubernetes in a
reasonable timeframe with minimal disruption, a goal we achieved.}

\accomplish {Contributed features and bug fixes to the consumer support
web site, built in Java/Spring, supporting an average of 200,000 daily
users worldwide with over two dozen country/language localizations,
coordinating many phone and chat support partners and vendors, and
available in multiple layouts including responsive/mobile and
right-to-left languages.}

\employer
  {Eugene School District 4J --- Eugene, OR}
  {Senior Application Developer, 2011--2016}

\accomplish{Converted student-oriented data for a roughly 16,000 student
school district from the discontinued AAL product eSIS, running on
Linux and Oracle, to Edupoint's Synergy running on Microsoft
Windows Server 2008 and Microsoft SQL Server 2008 R2.}

\accomplish{Collaborated with school administrators to develop the Early
Warning System, a report used to identify, based on attendance and
failing grades, High School students who need additional help.}

\accomplish{Collaborated with school administrators and student counselors
to develop the Graduation Requirements Report, used both to
determine what each student still needs to accomplish in order to
graduate and, longitudinally, to track performance from school to
school and across the district. The graduation requirements
information had been available only for individual students and
could take up to 30 seconds per student to load. The Graduation
Requirements Report combined that data with additional
demographics and exported all students for a school or even the
entire district to Excel for later sorting and other
manipulations.}

\accomplish{Built and/or maintained a number of processes to extract data
from the Student Information System for import into third-party
systems such as Naviance, a college and career readiness platform,
and Follett Destiny, a Library Management System, as well as
several others. The extracts were developed in BASH, Perl,
PowerShell, SQL Server Integration Services, and other languages
and tools, and spread across a number of Linux and Windows
systems, executing from within Oracle or SQL Server or from cron
jobs and other configurations.}

\accomplish{For the new Student Information System I worked to standardize
all third-party integrations into SSIS packages and PowerShell
scripts, with a small number of Perl scripts, all running on one
system managed through SQL Server Management Studio to reduce the
confusion and documentation involved in routine modifications and
in troubleshooting problems.}

\accomplish{Wrote processes to import student assessments into
Synergy. The handled assessments include ACT, AP, easyCBM,
EXPLORE, OAKS, PLAN, PSAT, SAT, SBAC, and Work Keys with a system
that is simple to modify so that as new assessments are
implemented in the district they can easily be imported into the
Student Information System.}

\accomplish{Wrote often complicated SQL on a daily basis to investigate
questions and troubleshoot problems, at all times striving to
improve both accuracy and efficiency.}

  {Software Engineer, 2005--2011}

\accomplish{Served as the primary contact for all UNIX server issues and
helped IT troubleshoot and solve various problems involving httpd
servers and application containers as well as network connectivity
problems, permissions issues, symbolic links, etc.}

\accomplish{Architecture lead responsible for investigating, implementing,
and teaching new methods and frameworks, such as unit testing and
test driven development.}

\accomplish{Took over the lead maintainer role for Monarch, a Flex MVC
framework derived from Cairngorm, used in our award winning
One-Click Support project for the Norton line of consumer
products.}

\accomplish{Maintainer for a Ruby project that
consolidated XML data files into a compressed Action Message Format
(AMF) file that reduced load times for a Flex consumer support
application.}

\accomplish{Primary server administrator for our internal system,
installing, configuring, and maintaining PostgreSQL and MySQL
RDBMSs, Apache httpd, BEA Weblogic and Apache Tomcat application
servers, user accounts, and various individual needs.}

linking system, written in Java, that, by connecting consumer
product customers to step-by-step instructions, helped them solve
their problems without having to contact our support departments,
thereby substantially reducing Symantec's support costs.}
